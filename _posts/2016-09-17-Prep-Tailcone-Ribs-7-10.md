Deburred and Primed rear tailcone rib components.

Rivetted together.  Had a lot of trouble getting the upper center rivets to go in smoothly.

Also the Vans recommended rivets are borderline too short so, I tried putting in 1 longer rivet but it wanted to bend over when squeezed.  I put in 4 of these but removed all but one of these rivets.
