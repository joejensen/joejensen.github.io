Received the complete airframe tookit from Cleaveland Tools today.  I inventoried it and received everything except 1 of the countersink cutters.  It's such a minor part I'm just going to wait and see if I need it anytime soon when the kit comes in tommorow and I have a change to go over the instructions.
