Countersinking and riveting on nutplates.  

Cleaned and primered all 5 parts of the spar cap just prior to riveting.

Had to drill out my first rivet when riveting on 1 of the nutplates.  Ended up having the remove both rivets holding on the nutplate in question since I warped the nutplate when trying to remove the shop end of the rivet.
