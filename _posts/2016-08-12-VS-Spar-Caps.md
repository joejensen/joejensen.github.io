Cut apart the upper and lower spar caps and deburred.

Drew alignment lines on the lower spar caps and aligned them with the appropriate holes, aligned the upper spar caps with the bottom of the spar.  Used cleco C clamps to hold in place while drilling the needed #30 holes to hold them in place while drilling out the rest of the holes.

After drilling out all the holes I deburred all the newly created holes.  Still need to debur the undrilled holes on the spar if they are not drilled out in later instructions.
